### About my journey ðŸš€
In 2023 i decied to quit my full time job to go full developer mode. I completed [CS50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CS50) in the spring of 2023, and I got accepted to TeknikhÃ¶gskolan, [Pythonutvecklare AI](https://teknikhogskolan.se/utbildningar/pythonutvecklare-ai), wich can be translated to Python programmer with AI orientation.

On my free time i spend my free time to learn about Computer Science and the fundamentals of a various of programming languages. __This is just the beginning of my journey__ ðŸ‘¶
